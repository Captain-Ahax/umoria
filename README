This is the source for Umoria 5.2, a dungeon exploration game.  This is my
second major release of the game.  These sources have been compiled
successfully at least once in the following environments: UNIX (4.2 BSD,
4.3 BSD, SYS V, Xenix, and many similar systems), IBM-PC (MSC 5.0,
Turbo C 4.0), Mac (MPW 3.0), Atari ST (MWC, GCC).  VMS and Mac (Think C 4.0)
ports are in progress.

I consider these to be beta sources.  That means they will probably work
on your system, but there are no guarantees.  Also, I reserve the right to
change game features at any time, with no advance notice, as I am still
tuning various features in the game.  However, I will not make any major
changes affecting savefiles, so old 5.x savefiles will continue to be
accepted.

People who are accustomed to Umoria 4.87 MUST read the file doc/FEATURES.NEW
which documents many of the user visible features.  Don't send me bug reports
unless you have read the file.

Umoria 5.x does not understand Umoria 4.87 savefiles.  The changes to the
game are so great, that supporting the old savefile format is not worth
the effort.  Implementing a savefile conversion program will be an almost
impossible task, and at least two people have tried and not succeeded.

You may distribute modified copies of this game.  However, you must clearly
indicate the extent and purpose of the changes.  Also, if the changes are
extensive, I request that you call your sources something other than
`umoria' so that they won't be confused with my version of the game.
I would also appreciate receiving a copy of your changes, so that good ideas
can be added back into my version.
