Requires a version of curses (a screen management package) for the Atari ST.

The most common curses for the Atari ST has some variable definitions in
curses.h.  The easiest way to handle this is to precompile curses.o, and
delete the declarations from curses.h before compiling umoria.

The sets.c and undef.c files have some #pragma lines which will have
to be deleted or commented out, as the MWC preprocessor does not understand
them.
