A History of Moria: written by Jim Wilson
	this history is somewhat biased towards the Umoria versions because
	those are the versions that I am most familiar with, info for the
	VMS versions may be inaccurate

VMS Moria 4.8: last version by original authors, R.A. Koeneke, etc.,
	developed at Univ Oklahoma in VMS Pascal

VMS Moria 5.0: developed at Univ Buffalo, VMS Pascal; has a Black
	Market where one can purchase enchanted magic items at 100 times
	normal value, a few bug fixes over 4.8 Moria, some new monsters

VMS Moria 6.0: under development at Villanova by Rick Greene; some more
	bug fixes over VMS 5.0 (some borrowed from Umoria 4.87), more new
	monsters, reduced map display (borrowed from PC-Moria),
	this version was never finished and is apparently defunct

UMoria 4.87: developed by Jim Wilson at UC Berkeley;
	very many bugs and inconsistencies in 4.8 fixed, rewritten
	in C for better portability, Atari/Mac/UNIX versions identical,
	character rerolling, no help facility like the VMS versions, etc.

PC-Moria 4.873: developed by Don Kneller; same as Umoria 4.87 except the
	sources will compile on machines with 16 bit integers, reduced map
	display

Amiga Moria v3.0: bitmapped graphics unlike ascii graphics of other versions,
	has weapons of Godly Might and other changes that make it far far
	easier than all other Moria versions

BRUCE Moria: developed by Christopher J. Stuart at Monash University,
	somewhere in Australia; monster memories, look any direction code,
	settable options, better run/find code, can center character on
	screen, stat code rewritten to fix bugs, rudimentory help facility
	added, plus many other enhancements, experimental version,
	source never publicly released

UMoria 5.0: under developement by Jim Wilson at UC Berkeley; unified source
	for UNIX/IBM-PC/Atari/Mac/VMS, many new features
	borrowed from BRUCE Moria, more bug fixes, all floating point code
	eliminated, many changes that affect play balance (hopefully for
	the better), many type/structure changes

Vertical position indicates roughly when the versions were made available,
although the scale is not very accurate.
