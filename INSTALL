First, you have to put every file in the 'source' directory, and every file
in your machine/OS specific directory into a common directory.  If you are on a
UNIX machine and running csh, the following works nicely if typed from this
directory.
*****
foreach i (source/* unix/*)
ln -s $i $i:t
end
******

To compile the program, edit the config.h file to change the
names of the files the game uses.  Also, uncomment the appropriate
line for the system you are compiling on. Type make (or build
or whatever) to compile the game.  You may want to edit the 'files/hours' file
to indicate during what hours people are allowed to play the game.  (The
micro versions don't use this file.)

The game needs to be installed setuid on UNIX systems for the scoreboard
to work.  Use the command 'chmod 4511 moria' to do this.
N.B. The scoreboard is currently not implemented, so this doesn't matter.
The file scores should be mode 644 with the same owner as moria.
The files hours and news must be publicly readable with mode 444.
(Or just type 'make install' after setting BINDIR and LIBDIR in the
Makefile to appropriate values.)

There are two choices for the key bindings, the original style and
a rogue-like style.  You can choose which one is to be the default
by changing the value of ROGUE_LIKE in config.h.

Moria only has partial support for SYS III and VMS.  It probably won't
compile and run under these systems without a bit of work.

If your compiler has a seven character identifier limit, the shortnam.sed
file will solve the problem nicely.
